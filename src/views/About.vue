          <h2>The System</h2>
        </template>
        JeePS is a system that enables you to monitor several service contracting measures, just by uploading a GPX file. These measures include counting the total distance travelled, checking for speeding violations, checking for stop violations, and counting the number of loops made. All the information is presented alongside a map for visualization. These features are especially important with the shift towards a service contracting scheme.
